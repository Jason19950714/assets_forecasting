# assets_forecasting
A key part in the asset-allocation process is the estimation of parameters, which is the inputs of a allocation model. In the past, simple linear extrapolation using historical data was not logically advisable. To better achieve asset allocation, it is very necessary to predict the risk, return of assets, and the correlations between assets. This research briefly explores the forecasting methods for returns, volatility, and correlations, conducts empirical tests, and achieves certain forecasting effects. In the future, optimizations can be made in terms of model input features, forecasting models, and specific model construction.
